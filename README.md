# colorgame
This page was created as a project for the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/"> Web Developer Bootcamp </a> on Udemy.com 
<br/>The purpose of the game is to match the correct color with the RGB code generated automatically.
<br/>The project uses javascript to generate automatically a color that needs to be guessed by the user as well as pairs of 3 or 6 random calors from which the user can guess what the RGB code stands for.
